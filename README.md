## About 'Neurorise'

Neurorise is a game that randomly generates animal cards in a particular order, which the user must remember and then select the cards in the correct sequence to clear each stage. Rather than simply remembering animal shapes, I added an element of card color to make the game more complex and effectively improve memory skills. Additionally, I implemented 3D effects when the user drags the animal cards to make the game more visually interesting and engaging.

I also incorporated various animations, sound effects, and background music to prevent the user from becoming bored with the app and encourage continued use. The game gradually increases in difficulty, with the number of cards to be memorized increasing by one with each stage. This progressive difficulty helps users naturally improve their memory skills.
